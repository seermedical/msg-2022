# Computational Restrictions for Submissions

- [Go back to Main](../README.md)
- [Go back to Submission Code](create_code.md)

## Restrictions

The submission you make must take the following computational resource limits into consideration and not exceed them. 

- **CPU :** 4 cpu cores will be available to you.
- **RAM :** Approx 16Gb of memory will be available.
- **GPU :** 1 GPU, with 16Gb of memory will be available.
- **Run Time :** Your submission should run within approx 10 minutes or less. If submissions take too long to run, they will fail.
    - There are approximately `2,500` inputs in the test dataset. So your code should be capable of processing at least `4.2` inputs per second in order to stay within the time limit.
