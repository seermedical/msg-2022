# Create Submissions Script Code

- [Go back to Main](../README.md)

## Create Code

The code that creates predictions must take the following things into account.

- [Expected inputs](inputs.md): Must load input data from a specific location.
- [Expected outputs](outputs.md): Predictions must be saved in a specific format, in a specific location.
- [Computational restrictions](restrictions.md): Must not exceed these computational restrictions.

## Starter Code

If you are using Python, then you can make use of the `submission.py` starter script we have provided. It is already configured to read data from the expected location and outputs predictions to the expected file location as explained above. 

All you need to do is write code to load your model, and make a prediction for each input file.
