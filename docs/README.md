## 1. Requirements For Docker Submission

1. Your application must load data from the `/dataset/test`  directory in the docker container.

    - The data is stored as separate files with the following directory structure:

    ```bash
    dataset
        test 
            NNNN
                SSS
                    UTC-YYYY_MM_DD-hh_mm_ss.parquet
                    UTC-YYYY_MM_DD-hh_mm_ss.parquet
                SSS
                    UTC-YYYY_MM_DD-hh_mm_ss.parquet

    # NNNN                              = Patient id
    # SSS                               = Session id 
    # UTC-YYYY_MM_DD-hh_mm_ss.parquet   = Single input to your model
    ```

2. Your application should generate predictions, and save it as a csv.
    - Should be saved to `/submission/submission.csv` in the docker container.
    - Structure of csv should look like:

    ```
    filepath,prediction
    path_to_file,probability
    path_to_file,probability
    path_to_file,probability
    ...
    ```

    - Example:

    ```
    filepath,prediction
    1111/002/UTC-2020_02_27-13_00_00.parquet,0.417022004702574
    1111/002/UTC-2020_02_27-12_00_00.parquet,0.7203244934421581
    1111/001/UTC-2020_02_26-22_00_00.parquet,0.00011437481734488664
    ```


## 2. Build Docker Image

1. Create your code, and [be mindful of compatibility issues](compatibility.md) ahead of time.
2. Edit the dockerfile, and [be mindful of these docker image tips](dockerfile.md).
3. Build it

    ```bash
    docker build --tag evalai-submission .
    ```

## 3. Test Your Docker Container Locally

To test that your Docker container does the right thing, do the following.

1. Download dummy version of the test dataset.
    - Download this zip file https://eval-ai-msg-data.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/dummy_test.zip
    - Extract it somewhere.
    - You should end up with a path that looks like `/path_to/dummy_test/test/`
2. Run the following commands:

    ```bash
    # ========================
    # SETTINGS
    # ========================
    # Change this one to point to where your `dummy_data` directory is stored.
    # NOTE: `LOCAL_DATA_DIR` and `LOCAL_PREDICTIONS_DIR` must be an absolute paths.
    LOCAL_DATA_DIR="$(pwd)/dummy_test"
    LOCAL_PREDICTIONS_DIR="$(pwd)/submission"

    # ========================
    # RUN DOCKER CONTAINER.
    # ========================
    # This will:
    # - Mount your local data dir to `/dataset` on the container.
    # - Mount your local predictions dir to `/submission` on the container.
    #   Which will allow you to see the results once docker contaier finishes
    #   running.
    # - Run the entrypoint script you specified in your docker container.
    docker run --rm\
        --name evalai-submission\
        -v ${LOCAL_DATA_DIR}:/dataset\
        -v ${LOCAL_PREDICTIONS_DIR}:/submission\
        evalai-submission
    ```

   - Running this will create a new directory `predictions` in your current working directory.
   - If the docker container is set up correctly, there should be a `predictions.csv` file saved in that directory.

3. Check the outputs of your script.
   - Open up the `submission/submission.csv` file and ensure it is structured correctly.
    - It should contain 12 rows of predictions, and look something like this:

    ```
    filepath,prediction
    1050/002/UTC-2019_11_14-02_00_00.parquet,0.417022004702574
    1050/002/UTC-2019_11_14-04_00_00.parquet,0.7203244934421581

    ```

    ```bash
    evalai set_token XXXXXXXXXXXX
    ```

### 4.2. Make actual submission
